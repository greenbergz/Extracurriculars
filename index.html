        <hr>
          <a href="Go-Bears" rel="modal:open"><img src="pictures/bearsedit.jpg"></a>
        <p></p>There are a wide variety of things that students can get involved in and around campus. The three largest categories are varisity sports, club and intramural sports, and clubs and groups. If you find that you need to do more at Wash U than just classes it is highly recommended that you look into joining one of these groups. Joining these groups will also help students acclimate by giving them a new group of people that they will be able to see on a regular basis in a non school envirionment </p>

          <p> Club sports are great for students who want to play competitively but do not want to invest as much time into the sport. With Less frequent practices and less traveling club sports can be a great subsitute for varisity sports. Another way to stay active is to join an intramural sport. These sports have the least time commitment as they often do not ask for any practice and will not travel. They are great way for a group of students to get together a play a sport of their choice about once a week.</p>
